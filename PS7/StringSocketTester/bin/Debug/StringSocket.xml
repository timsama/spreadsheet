             <summary> 
             A StringSocket is a wrapper around a Socket.  It provides methods that
             asynchronously read lines of text (strings terminated by newlines) and 
             write strings. (As opposed to Sockets, which read and write raw bytes.)  
            
             StringSockets are thread safe.  This means that two or more threads may
             invoke methods on a shared StringSocket without restriction.  The
             StringSocket takes care of the synchonization.
             
             Each StringSocket contains a Socket object that is provided by the client.  
             A StringSocket will work properly only if the client refrains from calling
             the contained Socket's read and write methods.
             
             If we have an open Socket s, we can create a StringSocket by doing
             
                StringSocket ss = new StringSocket(s, new UTF8Encoding());
             
             We can write a string to the StringSocket by doing
             
                ss.BeginSend("Hello world", callback, payload);
                
             where callback is a SendCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
             This is a non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has 
             successfully written the string to the underlying Socket, or failed in the 
             attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are a
             (possibly null) Exception and the payload.  If the Exception is non-null, it is
             the Exception that caused the send attempt to fail.
             
             We can read a string from the StringSocket by doing
             
                 ss.BeginReceive(callback, payload)
                 
             where callback is a ReceiveCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
             This is non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has read a
             string of text terminated by a newline character from the underlying Socket, or
             failed in the attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are
             a (possibly null) string, a (possibly null) Exception, and the payload.  Either the
             string or the Exception will be non-null, but nor both.  If the string is non-null, 
             it is the requested string (with the newline removed).  If the Exception is non-null, 
             it is the Exception that caused the send attempt to fail.

            <summary>
            Creates a StringSocket from a regular Socket, which should already be connected.  
            The read and write methods of the regular Socket must not be called after the
            LineSocket is created.  Otherwise, the StringSocket will not behave properly.  
            The encoding to use to convert between raw bytes and strings is also provided.

            We can write a string to a StringSocket ss by doing
            
               ss.BeginSend("Hello world", callback, payload);
               
            where callback is a SendCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
            This is a non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has 
            successfully written the string to the underlying Socket, or failed in the 
            attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are a
            (possibly null) Exception and the payload.  If the Exception is non-null, it is
            the Exception that caused the send attempt to fail. 
            
            This method is non-blocking.  This means that it does not wait until the string
            has been sent before returning.  Instead, it arranges for the string to be sent
            and then returns.  When the send is completed (at some time in the future), the
            callback is called on another thread.
            
            This method is thread safe.  This means that multiple threads can call BeginSend
            on a shared socket without worrying around synchronization.  The implementation of
            BeginSend must take care of synchronization instead.  On a given StringSocket, each
            string arriving via a BeginSend method call must be sent (in its entirety) before
            a later arriving string can be sent.
