Aundrea and I worked well together on this. We struggled a bit with the socket implementation, but we got through it. As partners, we tried to make sure to switch keyboard use back and forth, because it was difficult for me to not just type things myself. I think our main two problems were with understanding manual reset events, and with the tests themselves. It was hard to know whether other students' tests were actually correct or not, and so we wasted a lot of time trying to figure out when our stringsocket was wrong, and when the other students' tests were wrong.

When we got access to the grading tests later on to attempt a regrade, we got the stringsocket whipped into shape pretty quickly.
