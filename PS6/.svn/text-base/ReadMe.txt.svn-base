To see my cool feature, use the Options button to see the ability to change the language of the GUI. (Native Windows controls will still be in the system's set language) These are not hardcoded, or even compiled into the program; any properly-formatted .glx ("GUI Langage XML") file in the application folder will be added to the list of language options. Try copying one, naming it after the language of your choosing and then change the strings inside its XML tags to a translation into that language, and then watch that language appear as an option the next time you run the spreadsheet. It's fully-internationalizeable: it even can use Japanese Kanji. If you're Makito, try correcting my Japanese and see the changes the next time you run the program.

My code coverage highlighting is acting very strangely, so I had to make due with just using the block identification part, and only got about 92% code coverage.
